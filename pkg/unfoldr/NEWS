This file is intended for further news about bug fixes and further modifications of the package.


Changes with 0.6.8
-------------------
1) With this current version there is only a single function for simulation of Poisson germ-grain processes with
spheres, spheroids and spherocylinders. Functions 'simSpheroidSystem', 'simSphereSystem' and simCylinderSystem'
are no further available.

2) Added routines for digitization of all types of section profiles 

3) The lengths of the major, minor and second minor axis of spheroids are now all stored where both shorter
lengths are still equal since up to now only spheroids are available for simulation. This might be changed in the future
for the simulation of general ellipsoids.
