\usage{
trivarHist(A, main = paste("Trivariate Histogram"), scale = 0.5, col, ...)
}

\arguments{
	\item{A}{ 3d array of count data}
	\item{main}{ main title}
	\item{scale}{ factor to scale the spheres}
	\item{col}{ vector of color values repeatedly used}
	\item{...}{optional graphic arguments}
}

\value{
  the graphical output: trivariate histogram
}

\description{
Plot trivariate histogram of size, shape, orientation distribution
}
\details{
The (estimated spatial) joint size-shape-orientation distribution is plotted
in a box with corresponding axes shown. The axes intersect in the first class number.
The ball volumes visualize the relative frequencies of count data for each class which 
can be scaled by the user for non-overlapping spheres.
Balls within the same size class have the same color.
