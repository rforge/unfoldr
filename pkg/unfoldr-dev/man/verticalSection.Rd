\title{Spheroid vertical section}
\usage{
verticalSection(S, d, n = c(0, 1, 0), intern = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{S}{list of spheroids, see \code{\link{simSpheroidSystem}}}

\item{d}{distance of intersecting plane to the origin}

\item{n}{normal vector of intersting plane}

\item{intern}{\code{intern=FALSE} (default) return all section profiles otherwise
only those which have their centers inside the intersection window}
}
\value{
list of size, shape and angle of section profiles
}
\description{
Vertical section of spheroid system
}
\details{
The function performs a vertical intersection defined by the normal vector
\code{n=c(0,1,0)} which depends on the main orientation axis of the
coordinate system and has to be parallel to this.
